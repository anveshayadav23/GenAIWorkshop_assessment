/*
Generate a complete ASP.NET Core Web API controller for a "Product" entity with the following requirements:

Supports full CRUD operations using RESTful principles:
   - GET all products
   - GET product by ID
   - POST a new product
   - PUT to update a product by ID
   - DELETE a product by ID

Returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
   - 200 OK
   - 201 Created
   - 204 NoContent
   - 400 BadRequest
   - 404 NotFound
   - 500 InternalServerError

Uses [ApiController], [Route("api/[controller]")], and method-level HTTP annotations like [HttpGet], [HttpPost], etc.

Includes model validation with [Required], [FromBody], and validation error handling using ModelState.

Handles errors gracefully with try-catch blocks and provides meaningful error messages.

Uses an in-memory list for product storage (no database connection needed).

The Product class should have:
   - Id (int)
   - Name (string, required)
   - Price (decimal, required)
   - Description (string, optional)
