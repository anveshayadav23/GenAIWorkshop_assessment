/* 

Create a C# service class in ASP.NET Core to integrate with a third-party payment API.

Requirements:
- Implement three methods: 
    - ProcessPaymentAsync(PaymentRequest): sends payment data and returns the API response.
    - RefundPaymentAsync(paymentId): issues a refund for the provided payment ID.
    - GetPaymentStatusAsync(paymentId): fetches the payment status from the API.

- Use HttpClient to make HTTP requests with proper timeout and retry logic using Polly.
- Ensure all responses are mapped to a PaymentResponse model with Success, ErrorMessage, and Status.
- Include structured error handling for API and network failures.
- Log all input/output and errors using ILogger for audit trail purposes.  */
